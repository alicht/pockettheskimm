Pocket theSkimm
===========

Pocket theSkimm is simple Rails app that automatically Pockets all of that day's Skimm. Simply go to [pockettheskimm.com](pockettheskimm.com) and you can send all of the links in that day's Skimm directly to Pocket.

Here's a [Medium Post](https://medium.com/@alicht/introducing-pocket-theskimm-476f8f852d0f#.lu0tl2ixg) explaining how it was built.
